# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

- This project is about Louise's fundraising campaigns in different countries. Since Louise is interested in starting a campaign in Theater, the 
  analysis was carried out filtering the data of the theatre category.
 
## Analysis and Challenges

- This analysis was done using the excel application. The dataset was filtered, sorted and setup based on the launch date and outcomes of the theatre
  category. Pivot tables and charts were created basis the theater outcomes by launch date and outcomes based on goals.


## Results

###### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

   - The best time to launch the campaign is May as it has the maximum successful campaigns
   - All months had alomost the same number of failed campiagns launched.

##### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 
  - The success rate started dropping and failure rate went up as the goals increased. So. there is a need to put a cap on the price to ask
  - The most successful goal category was 1000 to 4999 and the worst was between 45000 to 49999. It will make more sense if there are only a few goal 
    categories below and above 1000 to 4999 
  
##### What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - The median of the goals is lower than the mean of the goals. This means there are outliers in the high end of the distribution

##### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

   - We could calculate the central tendency of the data and use the box and whiskers chart to identify the outliers
